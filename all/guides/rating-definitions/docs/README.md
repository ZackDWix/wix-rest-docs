## Use cases

This article shares some possible use cases your app can support. You are not limited to these use cases, but they can be a helpful jumping off point as you plan your integration.

### Allow users to define their own rating attributes

1. Create user input for a new rating, providing at least one attribute's ID (name).
2. Pass user input to the [Create Definition](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/drafts/rating-definitions/create-definition) endpoint to set up the new type of rating.
3. Update user interface with the new rating type automatically by subscribing to the [Definition Created Webhook](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/drafts/rating-definitions/definition-created-webhook).
