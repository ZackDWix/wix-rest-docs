# Sample Use Case & Flow: Wix Local Delivery

This article shares possible use cases your app could support, as well as an example flow.
You're certainly not limited to these use cases, but it can be a helpful jumping off point
as you plan your app's implementation.

## Local Delivery App on Wix
Your app will help site owners connect to a delivery service so that they can offer their users the ability to receive both future and ASAP orders. When a site owner receives an online order, they’ll be prompted to accept the order and provide an estimated pickup time, which is the time the delivery driver should arrive at the restaurant to pick up the items.

In order to ensure a good customer experience, Wix highly recommends you provide feedback to the customer about their order. For example, sending text message notifications that the delivery driver is on the way, has arrived and dropped off the food, are good practice.

Additionally, for the site owner, it’s important to offer an intuitive and efficient onboarding experience. Your app will be responsible for ensuring that the site owner fills out all necessary legal and contractual agreements, and is informed of pricing, fees, and payment terms.
