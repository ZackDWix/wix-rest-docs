### About This API

Add HTML snippets to the live site

These snippets allow you to verify site ownership, monitor your traffic and track user activity as well as the success of your campaigns.

When adding the code, you can choose whether to include it in all pages or specific ones.

#### Notes:
* Your code snippets are associated with a specific domain. If you assign a different domain to your site your code snippets will be deleted. There is no need to add code snippets to your secondary domain, as all traffic is redirected to your primary domain.
* To help your site be compliant with privacy laws such as the GDPR, we recommend you categorize your custom code.
